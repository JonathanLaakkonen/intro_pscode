#Task A: Guess the Number Game
	Write Pseudo Code for a number guessing game. The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 10, and the player has 3 chances to guess.

Have the computer save a number randomly picked from a list of 1-10.

Create a tracker for the number of tries that the player has and set it to 3.

Have the player input a number from between 1 and 10, if they guess is correct they win, otherwise the tries counter goes down by 1.

Check how many tries the player has left, if itâ€™s greater than 0, they can try again, otherwise they lose the game.
